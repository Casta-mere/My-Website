# About This site

This blog site is long overdue

Though my writing may lack elegance

I do hope this corner of the web can hold some of my thoughts and learnings, thus this little site came to be

If any words here can bring some inspiration or help to readers, then this site's existence would carry even greater meaning

This site has been running for <RoughNotation type="underline" show={true} color="#32CD32"  strokeWidth={2} animationDelay={2000} ><DaysCounter startDate="2023-09-21"/></RoughNotation> days, and has received a total of <RoughNotation type="underline" show={true} color="#FFD700"  strokeWidth={2} animationDelay={3000} ><UmamiTotalViewCounter /></RoughNotation> visits

### Server

This site is hosted on Alibaba Cloud, currently using a cheap instance at 99 RMB/year, expiring on 2026-9-2.

Specifications:

- Ubuntu 22.04 64-bit
- 2 cores (vCPU) 2GiB RAM
- East China 1 (Hangzhou)

### Domain

This site's domain is `castamerego.com`, purchased from Alibaba Cloud at 90 RMB/year, currently paid up to 2026-11-17

ICP certification is [浙 ICP 备 2022034316 号-1](https://beian.miit.gov.cn/)

with some subdomains for different projects:

- `www.castamerego.com` this blog site
- `umami.castamerego.com` umami data statistics backend
- `readbook.castamerego.com` Read-Book project
- `mind-scout.castamerego.com` Mind-Scout project

### Development Flow

The development flow is as follows:

The Dev version is deployed on a NAS at home, connected via Tailscale at work, and directly connected at home

After each update, I first test `npm run build` locally, and if there are no issues, I directly SCP the built content to the server, where I run `npm run serve`

GitHub is only used for version control, and I have not yet attempted GitHub Pages deployment

The benefits of this approach are as follows:

- Regardless of location, the Dev version is always the same, allowing for seamless transitions between work and home
- The server does not need to build, reducing performance requirements (the server is currently unable to build)

### SSL Certificate

This site uses HTTPS, with SSL certificate from Alibaba Cloud. Though it's a free **personal test certificate**, but it has to be renewed every three months recently, which is a bit troublesome

## 📊 Data Analysis

### Umami

The data statistics of this site is built with [Umami](https://umami.is), and data displayed at [Umami Dashboard](https://umami.castamerego.com/share/EplxZVQRe6OkyBt3/castamerego.com)

Collect following data:

- Page Views
- Visitors
- Bounce Rate
- Duration
- Specific Link Clicks
- Other data

One benefit is that data can be fetched and displayed via API within the site, for example: This site has been running for <RoughNotation type="underline" show={true} color="#32CD32"  strokeWidth={2} animationDelay={2000} ><DaysCounter startDate="2023-09-21"/></RoughNotation> days, and has received a total of <RoughNotation type="underline" show={true} color="#FFD700"  strokeWidth={2} animationDelay={3000} ><UmamiTotalViewCounter /></RoughNotation> visits

Based on this feature, I have also displayed the view count data on each blog and doc page
