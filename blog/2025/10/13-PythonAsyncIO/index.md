# Python's asyncio: A Hands-On Walkthrough

Python’s `asyncio` library enables you to write concurrent code using the `async` and `await` keywords. The core building blocks of async I/O in Python are awaitable objects—most often coroutines—that an event loop schedules and executes asynchronously. This programming model lets you efficiently manage multiple I/O-bound tasks within a single thread of execution

In this tutorial, you’ll learn how Python `asyncio` works, how to define and run coroutines, and when to use asynchronous programming for better performance in applications that perform I/O-bound tasks

**By the end of this tutorial, you’ll understand that**:

- Python’s `asyncio` provides a framework for writing single-threaded **concurrent code** using **coroutines**, **event loops**, and **non-blocking I/O operations**
- For I/O-bound tasks, async I/O **can often outperform multithreading**—especially when managing a large number of concurrent tasks—because it avoids the overhead of thread management.
- You should use `asyncio` when your application spends significant time waiting on **I/O operations**, such as network requests or file access, and you want to **run many of these tasks concurrently** without creating extra threads or processes.
